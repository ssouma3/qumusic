# Quantum Gate Circuit Music Generator

This project is a graphical tool for generating music using quantum circuits.
It was originally developed as part of the **IPA FY2018 MITOU "Unexplored" Target Program** in the *Quantum Gate Computing* category, supported by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Japan.

See the official project introduction here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [IPA 2018 Unexplored Quantum Gate Projects](https://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/target/2018/gate/seika-quantum-gate.html)


## Features

- Build quantum circuits interactively using a GUI
- Generate musical notes based on quantum measurement results
- Multiple modes (1-qubit, 2-qubit, chord mode, etc.)
- Real-time MIDI playback using `pygame.midi`
- Educational and creative: combines quantum logic and music

## Installation

It is recommended to use **Python 3.10 or later**.
You can recreate the environment using the provided YAML file:

```bash
conda env create -f qgcmg_v1.0.yml
conda activate quantum-music-mitou-win
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To launch the GUI:

```bash
python main.py
```
